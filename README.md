## About Bo
I live in East Tennessee. It's not that great. You wouldn't be interested. Kidding.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer and software engineering manager. Learn more about me professionally [here on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-martin/). I'm pretty sure I've done just about every job in computing. My current role is Director of Software Engineering at [Lirio](https://lirio.com/).

Personally, I'm a husband, uncle, brother, son and doggie daddy. I like playing and practicing golf. I like traveling with my lovely wife, Mary Eva. I love good live music.
